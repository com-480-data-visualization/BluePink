        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Crime is a daily concern for many New Yorkers, whether long-time
          residents, newcomers, or tourists. Yet, finding clear, intuitive, and
          localized information about crime in the city is surprisingly
          difficult. Most existing tools are either too technical, outdated, or
          lacking context. Our website aims to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built an interactive platform that allows anyone, from a concerned
          resident to a curious visitor, to explore crimes committed around them
          with just a few clicks. Using a dynamic map and easy-to-use filters,
          users can see exactly what types of crimes have occurred in specific
          neighborhoods, and when. Whether you're walking through Midtown or
          living in the Bronx, the platform gives you direct visibility into
          your local safety landscape, something that’s often hidden in
          overwhelming datasets or hard-to-navigate public records.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we didn’t stop at showing what happens. We also wanted to explore
          why. That’s why we integrated socio-economic data, like poverty and
          unemployment rates, into the experience. This added layer helps users
          understand the broader context: why some areas experience more crime
          than others, and how economic factors may influence safety. By
          combining intuitive crime mapping with meaningful social insight, our
          goal is to empower everyday users with knowledge. This tool isn't just
          for researchers or policymakers, it's for anyone who wants to better
          understand their city and make informed decisions, whether it's about
          where to live, travel, or advocate for change.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, we will present some statistics that we have gathered
          from the data. We will also show you how to interact with the plots
          and what they mean. We hope that this will help you understand the
          data better and make it more accessible.

          <p>
            Let's first take a look at the different types of crimes we
            considered. The dataset contained a wide variety of offenses,
            ranging from fraud and prostitution to kidnapping and murder. To
            simplify the analysis, we kept only the most common crime types and
            grouped them into categories that are easier for everyone to
            understand.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is then interesting to examine which crime types are the most
            frequent in New York City. The plot below illustrates this by
            showing the percentage that each crime category represents among all
            reported incidents between 2006 and 2023. We observe that the
            majority of crimes involve theft or physical assault. Serious crimes
            like rape and murder, while less common, still represent a
            significant concern — with an annual average of 1,398 rapes, 411
            murders, 1,085 arsons, and 186 kidnappings reported.

      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>
          We can see that crime complaints are relatively balanced across the
          boroughs, except for Staten Island, which accounts for only 4.64% of
          reported crimes. This is largely explained by the fact that Staten
          Island makes up just 5.8% of New York City’s population. Overall, the
          distribution of complaints appears to correlate with population size.
          Boroughs with more residents tend to report more crimes. However, we
          cannot draw definitive conclusions from this pattern alone. With only
          five boroughs, the Pearson correlation (r = 0.829, p = 0.0829) is not
          statistically significant. Notably, Queens is the second most populous
          borough but ranks only fourth in reported crimes. To uncover clearer
          trends and more nuanced insights, a deeper analysis at the district
          level is necessary. This is why our interactive map focuses on
          community districts rather than boroughs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding who is targeted by these crimes, if you are a woman, you
          might be interested in knowing that 54% of the victims of crime in New
          York City are women. This is a significant statistic that highlights
          the importance of addressing violence against women in our
          communities. On the contrary, about 75% of the suspect are men.

            Figure 3: Most dangerous hours in New York City from 2006 to 2023.
            We can see that less crimes arrive at night but we have to be
            careful with this information since there are also less people on
            the streets.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Finally, looking at when crimes occur, we can see that most of the
          crimes are committed during the day, mostly between 12:00 and 18:00
          with the pick around 15:00. This is likely due to the fact that more
          people are out during these hours, making it easier for criminals to
          commit crimes. However, it is important to note that this does not
          mean that it is safe to be out at night. In fact, the data shows that
          there are still a significant number of crimes committed at night,
          particularly between 18:00 and 24:00. It is always important to be
          aware of your surroundings and take precautions to stay safe, no
          matter what time of day it is.
        </p>

        <h2>Relation with Socio-Economic Factors</h2>
        <p>
          This leads us to a deeper question: why are crimes committed in the
          first place? It’s reasonable to think that many crimes are motivated
          by poverty, inequality, or a sense of injustice. When we look at the
          interactive map, it becomes clear that crime is not distributed evenly
          across districts—neither in terms of frequency nor in the types of
          crimes reported. It easy to think that socio-economic context of each
          district plays a role in shaping these patterns. For instance,
          wealthier districts might be more susceptible to theft or burglary,
          while economically disadvantaged areas could experience higher rates
          of drug- and weapon-related offenses. In the following section, we aim
          to uncover some of the socio-economic factors that influence crime
          rates across New York City.
        </p>

        <p>
          The above table shows the top three districts in terms of crime counts
          between 2006 and 2023. Despite its relative affluence and high
          employment, Midtown Business District tops the crime charts, driven
          largely by opportunistic theft, while Jamaica/St. Albans, with
          moderate poverty and employment levels, sees slightly fewer incidents
          but a greater share of assaults. East New York, by contrast, suffers
          both high poverty and low employment, and although its total crime
          count ranks third, violent offenses (especially physical assault)
          account for the largest slice, underscoring how socio-economic stress
          shifts the balance from property crime toward interpersonal violence.
          The link between socio-economic factors and crime is complex, and at a
          first glance is not evident. However the living conditions in the
          district seem to have a direct impact on the types of crimes committed
          in each district. We will further investiguate this relationship.

          Before diving into the crime data, let’s take a step back and examine
          the socio-economic landscape of New York City. The chart below
          illustrates the evolution of the poverty rate in NYC from 2006 to
          2023. Over this period, the poverty rate has remained relatively
          stable, with a noticeable uptick in 2020, likely a consequence of the
          economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite minor
          fluctuations, poverty remains a pressing issue in the city: in 2023,
          <strong
            >18.88% of New Yorkers were living below the federal poverty
            line</strong
          >, compared to the national average of 11.1%. This translates to
          nearly one in five residents struggling to make ends meet, with the
          threshold set at $14,580 annually for an individual and $30,000 for a
          family of four.<sup
            ><a
              href="https://dol.ny.gov/poverty-guidelines-2023"
              target="_blank"
              >[1]</a
            ></sup
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Regarding employment, the employment rate in NYC has generally hovered
          between 55% and 60%, with a dip around 2020 that aligns with
          widespread job losses and economic instability caused by the pandemic.
          Interestingly, there appears to be a negative correlation between
          poverty and employment: as the employment rate decreases, the share of
          people living under the federal poverty line tends to rise. This is
          confirmed by a statistically significant Spearman correlation
          coefficient of <em>ρ = –0.556</em> (p = 0.0254), supporting the
          intuitive link between employment and economic well-being.
          Unemployment remains a concern as well. In 2023, New York City's
          <strong>unemployment rate was 5.3%</strong>, considerably higher than
          the national average of 3.6%. This means that more than 1 in 20
          individuals in the city’s labor force were unemployed, underlining
          persistent structural challenges in the urban job market.<sup

          The table above highlights strong correlations between various crime
          categories and socioeconomic factors. Most crimes show a negative
          correlation with employment, suggesting that higher employment levels
          are generally associated with lower crime rates. This trend is
          particularly pronounced for offenses such as drug-related crimes,
          physical assault, and weapon possession. Notably, minor and major
          theft deviate from this pattern by showing positive correlations with
          employment. It’s important to note that the district associated with a
          crime refers to where the crime was committed, not necessarily where
          the perpetrator lives. One possible explanation is that areas with
          higher employment tend to be busier and more populated, providing more
          opportunities for thefts. These theft-related crimes also show negative
          correlations with poverty, which may reflect the greater availability
          of valuable items in wealthier districts. Among all categories, drug
          offenses display the most striking relationship: a strong positive
          correlation with poverty rate (+0.724) and a significant negative
          correlation with employment (-0.494). This suggests that drug-related
          crimes are far more prevalent in areas experiencing socioeconomic
          hardship, underscoring the link between precarity and this type of
          criminal behavior. Other crimes like intentional property fires also
          appear strongly tied to low employment levels. In contrast, crimes
          such as child abuse/endangerment, traffic violations, and fraud or
          forgery show no significant correlation with either socioeconomic
          factor, suggesting they occur relatively uniformly across the city,
          regardless of economic conditions.
