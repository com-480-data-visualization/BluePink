        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Crime is a daily concern for many New Yorkers, whether long-time
          residents, newcomers, or tourists. Yet, finding clear, intuitive, and
          localized information about crime in the city is surprisingly
          difficult. Most existing tools are either too technical, outdated, or
          lacking context. Our website aims to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built an interactive platform that allows anyone, from a concerned
          resident to a curious visitor, to explore crimes committed around them
          with just a few clicks. Using a dynamic map and easy-to-use filters,
          users can see exactly what types of crimes have occurred in specific
          neighborhoods, and when. Whether you're walking through Midtown or
          living in the Bronx, the platform gives you direct visibility into
          your local safety landscape, something that’s often hidden in
          overwhelming datasets or hard-to-navigate public records.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we didn’t stop at showing what happens. We also wanted to explore
          why. That’s why we integrated socio-economic data, like poverty and
          unemployment rates, into the experience. This added layer helps users
          understand the broader context: why some areas experience more crime
          than others, and how economic factors may influence safety. By
          combining intuitive crime mapping with meaningful social insight, our
          goal is to empower everyday users with knowledge. This tool isn't just
          for researchers or policymakers, it's for anyone who wants to better
          understand their city and make informed decisions, whether it's about
          where to live, travel, or advocate for change.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, we will present some statistics that we have gathered
          from the data. We will also show you how to interact with the plots
          and what they mean. We hope that this will help you understand the
          data better and make it more accessible.

            Let's first take a look at the different types of crimes we
            considered. The dataset contained a wide variety of offenses,
            ranging from fraud and prostitution to kidnapping and murder. To
            simplify the analysis, we kept only the most common crime types and
            grouped them into categories that are easier for everyone to
            understand.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is then interesting to examine which crime types are the most
            frequent in New York City. The plot below illustrates this by
            showing the percentage that each crime category represents among all
            reported incidents between 2006 and 2023. We observe that the
            majority of crimes involve theft or physical assault. Serious crimes
            like rape and murder, while less common, still represent a
            significant concern — with an annual average of 1,398 rapes, 411
            murders, 1,085 arsons, and 186 kidnappings reported.

          We can see that crime complaints are relatively balanced across the
          boroughs, except for Staten Island, which accounts for only 4.64% of
          reported crimes. This is largely explained by the fact that Staten
          Island makes up just 5.8% of New York City’s population. Overall, the
          distribution of complaints appears to correlate with population size.
          Boroughs with more residents tend to report more crimes. However, we
          cannot draw definitive conclusions from this pattern alone. With only
          five boroughs, the Pearson correlation (r = 0.829, p = 0.0829) is not
          statistically significant. Notably, Queens is the second most populous
          borough but ranks only fourth in reported crimes. To uncover clearer
          trends and more nuanced insights, a deeper analysis at the district
          level is necessary. This is why our interactive map focuses on
          community districts rather than boroughs.

          Regarding who is targeted by these crimes, if you are a woman, you
          might be interested in knowing that 54% of the victims of crime in New
          York City are women. This is a significant statistic that highlights
          the importance of addressing violence against women in our
          communities. On the contrary, about 75% of the suspect are men.

            Figure 3: Most dangerous hours in New York City from 2006 to 2023.
            We can see that less crimes arrive at night but we have to be
            careful with this information since there are also less people on
            the streets.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Finally, looking at when crimes occur, we can see that most of the
          crimes are committed during the day, mostly between 12:00 and 18:00
          with the pick around 15:00. This is likely due to the fact that more
          people are out during these hours, making it easier for criminals to
          commit crimes. However, it is important to note that this does not
          mean that it is safe to be out at night. In fact, the data shows that
          there are still a significant number of crimes committed at night,
          particularly between 18:00 and 24:00. It is always important to be
          aware of your surroundings and take precautions to stay safe, no
          matter what time of day it is.

        <h2>Relation with Socio-Economic Factors</h2>
        <p>
          But we can now wonder why are crimes commited? We can easlily imagine
          that most crimes are in fact motivated by poverty or a feeling of
          injustice. We will now try to uncover some socio-economic factors that
          may influence the crime rate in New York City. Looking at the
          interactive map we can see that the number of crimes is not evenly
          distributed across the districts as well as the types of crimes
          comited in each district. Th emost dangerous districts
