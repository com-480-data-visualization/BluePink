        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Crime is a daily concern for many New Yorkers, whether long-time
          residents, newcomers, or tourists. Yet, finding clear, intuitive, and
          localized information about crime in the city is surprisingly
          difficult. Most existing tools are either too technical, outdated, or
          lacking context. Our website aims to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built an interactive platform that allows anyone, from a concerned
          resident to a curious visitor, to explore crimes committed around them
          with just a few clicks. Using a dynamic map and easy-to-use filters,
          users can see exactly what types of crimes have occurred in specific
          neighborhoods, and when. Whether you're walking through Midtown or
          living in the Bronx, the platform gives you direct visibility into
          your local safety landscape, something that’s often hidden in
          overwhelming datasets or hard-to-navigate public records.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we didn’t stop at showing what happens. We also wanted to explore
          why. That’s why we integrated socio-economic data, like poverty and
          unemployment rates, into the experience. This added layer helps users
          understand the broader context: why some areas experience more crime
          than others, and how economic factors may influence safety. By
          combining intuitive crime mapping with meaningful social insight, our
          goal is to empower everyday users with knowledge. This tool isn't just
          for researchers or policymakers, it's for anyone who wants to better
          understand their city and make informed decisions, whether it's about
          where to live, travel, or advocate for change.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, we will present some statistics that we have gathered
          from the data. We will also show you how to interact with the plots
          and what they mean. We hope that this will help you understand the
          data better and make it more accessible.

        <h2>Crime Situation at New York City</h2>
        <p>
          Let first have a look at the diffrent types of crimes that we
          considered. The dataset contained a lot of various crimes, spanding
          from fraud or prostitution to kidnapping or murder. We decided to keep
          only certain type and to group them in categories.

          It is then interessant to look at which crime is the most frequent in
          New York City. The plot below illustrates this by showing the number
          of incidents for each crime category. In figure 2 we can see that most
          of the crimes are theft or physical assault. The the most serious
          crimes, like rape and murder, are fortunately much less frequent.
          Nevertheless, they still represent a significant concern for the
          community since in average, 1398 rape, 411 muder, 1085 arson fire and
          186 kidnapping complaints are reported each year.

          If you are a woman, you might be interested in knowing that 54% of the
          victims of crime in New York City are women. This is a significant
          statistic that highlights the importance of addressing violence
          against women in our communities. On the contrary, about 75% of the
          suspect are men.

          The plot below shows the population of alligators in Lac Léman over
          the last century. The data is based on a model that predicts the
          future population of alligators in the lake.

        The plots seems to be well correlated. Now let's look if a rich borough
        is safer than a poor one.
