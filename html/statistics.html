        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Crime is a daily concern for many New Yorkers, whether long-time
          residents, newcomers, or tourists. Yet, finding clear, intuitive, and
          localized information about crime in the city is surprisingly
          difficult. Most existing tools are either too technical, outdated, or
          lacking context. Our website aims to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built an interactive platform that allows anyone, from a concerned
          resident to a curious visitor, to explore crimes committed around them
          with just a few clicks. Using a dynamic map and easy-to-use filters,
          users can see exactly what types of crimes have occurred in specific
          neighborhoods, and when. Whether you're walking through Midtown or
          living in the Bronx, the platform gives you direct visibility into
          your local safety landscape, something that’s often hidden in
          overwhelming datasets or hard-to-navigate public records.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we didn’t stop at showing what happens. We also wanted to explore
          why. That’s why we integrated socio-economic data, like poverty and
          unemployment rates, into the experience. This added layer helps users
          understand the broader context: why some areas experience more crime
          than others, and how economic factors may influence safety. By
          combining intuitive crime mapping with meaningful social insight, our
          goal is to empower everyday users with knowledge. This tool isn't just
          for researchers or policymakers, it's for anyone who wants to better
          understand their city and make informed decisions, whether it's about
          where to live, travel, or advocate for change.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, we will present some statistics that we have gathered
          from the data. We will also show you how to interact with the plots
          and what they mean. We hope that this will help you understand the
          data better and make it more accessible.

            Let’s first take a look at the different types of crimes we
            considered. The dataset contained a wide variety of offenses,
            ranging from fraud and prostitution to kidnapping and murder. To
            simplify the analysis, we kept only the most common crime types and
            grouped them into categories that are easier for everyone to
            understand.

            Figure 2: Crime Distribution in New York City from 2006 to 2023. The
            top 3 crimes are minor theft that represent 19.49% of the crimes
            followed by physical assault (16.32%) and verbal or physical
            harassement (14.72%).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          It is then interessant to look at which crime is the most frequent in
          New York City. The plot above illustrates this by showing the
          percentage each crime category represents among all reported incidents
          between 2006 and 2023. We can see that most of the crimes are theft or
          physical assault. The most serious crimes, like rape and murder, are
          fortunately much less frequent. Nevertheless, they still represent a
          significant concern for the community since in average, 1398 rape, 411
          muder, 1085 arson fire and 186 kidnapping complaints are reported each
          year.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can see that crime complaints are relatively balanced across the
          boroughs, except for Staten Island, which accounts for only 4.64% of
          reported crimes. This is largely explained by the fact that Staten
          Island makes up just 5.8% of New York City’s population. Overall, the
          distribution of complaints appears to correlate with population size.
          Boroughs with more residents tend to report more crimes. However, we
          cannot draw definitive conclusions from this pattern alone. With only
          five boroughs, the Pearson correlation (r = 0.829, p = 0.0829) is not
          statistically significant. Notably, Queens is the second most populous
          borough but ranks only fourth in reported crimes. To uncover clearer
          trends and more nuanced insights, a deeper analysis at the district
          level is necessary. This is why our interactive map focuses on
          community districts rather than boroughs.

          Regarding who is targeted by these crimes, if you are a woman, you
          might be interested in knowing that 54% of the victims of crime in New
          York City are women. This is a significant statistic that highlights
          the importance of addressing violence against women in our
          communities. On the contrary, about 75% of the suspect are men.

            We can see that less crimes arrive at night but we have to be
            careful with this information since there are also less people on
            the streets.
