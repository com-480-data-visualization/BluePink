          This project was conducted by Mahdi Fourati, Elsa Heitz, and Beno√Æt
          Mathey-Doret as part of the EPFL course
          <em>Data Visualization</em> during the Spring 2025 semester. Its
          objective is to explore and visually represent crime patterns in New
          York City by integrating the NYC Crime Complaint Dataset (<a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniket0712/nypd-complaint-data-historic?resource=download"
            >Kaggle link</a
          >) with socio-economic information in New York (<a
            href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page"
            >NYC Planning link</a
          >).

          Rather than only plotting crime locations, the project seeks to
          uncover the underlying factors that influence crime by combining
          spatial, temporal, and socio-economic dimensions. The primary goal is
          to investigate how crime rates correlate with variables such as
          poverty, unemployment, and demographic composition across different
          districts of the city.

          The final outcome is an interactive, user-friendly tool designed to
          serve both the general public, such as residents or individuals
          considering a move to NYC and policymakers. It aims to highlight crime
          disparities, uncover trends, and identify potential root causes. By
          providing data-driven insights, the project supports better-informed
          decisions regarding urban safety policies and resource allocation.
